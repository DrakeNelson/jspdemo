Servlets
    Java Class that is processed on the server
    Java class generates HTML that is returned to the browser
    Can read HTML form data, use cookies and sessions etc...
    at a high-level, similar functionality to JSPs

Servlets
Process something on the server
Browser Sends -> Request to server
    Server Processes it
Servlet Sends -> <html> to browser

//similar to jsp but we create java class first and put out.println on all of the HTML that we send back to the browser
@WebServlet("/HelloWorldServlet")
public class HelloWorldServlet extends HttpServlet {
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)  throws ServletException, IOException {

    / Step 1: set the content type
    response.setContentType("text/html");

    // Step 2: get the printWriter
    PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();

    //step 3: generate HTML content
    out.println("<html><body>");

    out.println("<h2>Hello World</h2>");
    out.println("<hr>");
    out.println("time on the server is: " + new java.util.Date());

    Out.println("</body></html>");
    }
}

Note: While I have included this in the directory structure of the web folder there aren't actually any files here,
      This is because the files are actually in the classes up above
